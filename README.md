# line-follower
This project is an Arduino-based Line Follower RC Car that can follow a predefined path using an IR sensor. The car is powered by an L293D IC, and two hobby gear motors.

I have used tilt sensor in place of ir sensor in circuit images because ir sensor was not avilable in simulation software.
